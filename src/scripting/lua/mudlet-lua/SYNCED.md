# Bundled Mudlet Lua — provenance

This tree is a **verbatim mirror of Mudlet's `src/mudlet-lua/lua/`** (plus the
Lua translation catalogue Mudlet keeps at `translations/lua/mudlet-lua.json`).
`LuaRuntime.ts` globs it into the read-only `/lua/` VFS namespace, which is where
`LuaGlobal.lua`'s `dofile()` paths and `require()` resolve — so a file added here
is loadable with no further wiring.

`scripts/sync-mudlet-lua.mjs` mirrors **two** upstream directories at one commit,
and this file is the provenance record for both:

| Upstream | Vendored at | What it is |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `src/mudlet-lua/lua/` | `src/scripting/lua/mudlet-lua/` | this tree — the Lua runtime, served at `/lua/` |
| `src/packages/` | `src/import/defaults/` | the packages Mudlet preinstalls, one directory each |

A third piece of Mudlet is vendored on its own schedule and by its own script:
`src/TGameDetails.h` — the catalogue of games Mudlet ships with — becomes
`src/mud/games/bundledGames.ts` via `node scripts/sync-mudlet-games.mjs`. It is
separate because it is one C++ header parsed into data rather than files copied,
and because nothing tests it — no spec asserts anything about the catalogue, so
it can neither turn the busted corpus red nor afford to wait behind a corpus that
is. `sync-mudlet-upstream.yml` syncs it daily in a job of its own, with its own
branch and PR; you should never need to re-run it by hand.

They were one tree until Mudlet moved every default package into `src/packages/`
([#9626](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/pull/9626)). Note the second is only a
*supply* of packages: vendoring one does not preinstall it, and nothing there is
bundled unless `src/import/defaultPackages.ts` imports it. That file alone decides
what a profile gets.

- Upstream: https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/tree/development/src/mudlet-lua/lua
- Synced from commit: `49e6fd37efa2a9a37a3c61dcca498086f38079b6` (2026-09-26)
- Vendored files: 83 (plus 2 mudix-only)

**Keep this commit and `../specs/SYNCED.md`'s in step.** The specs are Mudlet's
own tests for exactly this code; running a newer corpus against an older tree
reports failures that are pure version skew, not mudix gaps. Re-sync both
together, pinning `--ref` to the same sha.

## Don't edit these files

Where mudix has to behave differently from desktop Mudlet, the fix goes **after
the tree loads**, not into it — `LuaRuntime.installMudletLuaOverrides()`, the
same tactic `installFastColorEcho()` uses for GUIUtils. That keeps the mirror
byte-identical, so a re-sync can never silently revert a mudix change, and
`git diff` after one shows only what Mudlet itself did.

Currently overridden:

| What | Why |
|------|-----|
| `mudlet.supports.mmcp = false` (`Other.lua`) | MMCP is peer-to-peer chat over a direct TCP socket, which a browser tab can't open. `mmcp.*` *is* bound, as no-op stubs (`Bridge.lua`), so feature-detecting scripts have to see it unsupported or they'll call into them. |
| `dispatchEventToFunctions`'s `pcall` (`Other.lua`) | It guards every event handler with `pcall`, and Lua 5.1 can't yield across `pcall`'s C frame — a handler suspending on `invokeFileDialog` dies there. `setfenv` re-points *that one function's* `pcall` at the coroutine-aware `__mudix_pcall_co`; every other global falls through to `_G`. Covered by `tests/scripting/invokeFileDialog.test.ts`, whose anonymous-event-handler case fails if the override is removed. |

**Backports** — upstream already has these, at a commit newer than the pin
above. They are not divergences and each is guarded so it defines nothing once
the real one arrives; **delete the block when a re-sync brings it in**.

| What | Upstream | Why it couldn't wait |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| `Adjustable.Container:remove` (`GeyserAdjustableContainer.lua`) | defined at `:879` on `development` | Without it the call resolves to `Geyser.Container.remove`, which searches the outer container's `windowList` — but an adjustable container keeps its children in `self.Inside`. The removal silently does nothing: no error, no return value, child still on screen ([#105](https://github.com/Mudlet/mudlet-web/issues/105)). Covered by `tests/scripting/adjustableContainerRemove.test.ts`. |

If an override ever proves impossible from the outside, the escape hatch is a
patch file under `scripts/mudlet-lua-patches/<tree>/` — but check first that
upstream doesn't already do what you're about to add. An early version of this
tree carried a `GeyserMiniConsole.lua` patch re-adding
`Geyser.MiniConsole:cechoLink/dechoLink/hechoLink` thirty lines below where
upstream already defines them.

A package is the one place where "override after loading" isn't available — its
scripts are installed into the profile, not loaded from this tree — so those do
take patches, under `scripts/mudlet-lua-patches/packages/`. **Currently none.**

The last one was `packages/gui-drop/gui-drop.xml` (a dropped image whose filename
starts with a digit generated a script that couldn't compile, losing the drop);
[Mudlet#9628](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/pull/9628) landed the same fix
upstream, so the patch went and `defaultPackages.ts` installs the
`gui-drop.mpackage` archive again rather than the loose XML. That's the general
shape: a patch can't reach inside an `.mpackage` (the sync must round-trip the
zip byte-for-byte), so a package needing one is installed from its loose XML
until upstream takes the fix. `tests/import/guiDropNaming.test.ts` still guards
the behaviour, reading the naming block out of the vendored package itself.

## mudix-only files (no upstream counterpart)

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `3rdparty/lulpeg.lua` | Pure-Lua LPeg. Mudlet links the C `lpeg` library; wasmoon has no way to. |
| `SYNCED.md` | This file. |

## Not vendored

| Upstream path | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| `CoreMudlet.lua` | LuaDoc-only; its whole body sits inside `if false then` and never executes. |
| `config.ld`, `ldoc.css` | LDoc doc-generation config, not runtime. |
| `.gitignore` | Repo housekeeping. |
| `src/packages/README.md` | Documents Mudlet's own preinstall wiring (`mudlet.qrc`, `setupPreInstallPackages`); mudix decides in `defaultPackages.ts`. |

## Re-syncing

```bash
yarn sync:mudlet-lua                        # GitHub, development branch
yarn sync:mudlet-lua --dry-run              # report what would change
yarn sync:mudlet-lua --ref v4.20.0          # any branch/tag/sha
yarn sync:mudlet-lua --from /path/to/Mudlet --fetch   # local checkout
```

`scripts/sync-mudlet-lua.mjs` pins one commit, copies every non-excluded file of
both trees verbatim (deleting any Mudlet retired — `--keep-removed` opts out),
re-applies any patches, and rewrites the header above. A patch that stops
applying is a hard failure, not a silent skip: the script exits non-zero, because
at that point the file is pristine upstream and the mudix change it carried is
gone from the tree.

The one thing the script can't do for you, and warns about: a package Mudlet
newly preinstalls is *vendored* but not *installed* until it's wired into
`src/import/defaultPackages.ts` — and see the mapper-defaults note in `CLAUDE.md`,
since exactly one mapper package may be default. `scripts/copy-lib-assets.mjs`
then needs no maintenance: it reads that file's `?url` imports and copies exactly
those into `dist-lib`, so an archive can't be imported and left out of the
library build.

Also keep `../specs/SYNCED.md` on the same commit.

## Who runs it

Nobody has to, and nothing has to remember that last sentence either:
`.github/workflows/sync-mudlet-upstream.yml` runs this sync and
`sync:mudlet-specs` daily as one operation, resolving the upstream sha once and
handing it to both — so the runtime and the corpus that tests it cannot end up on
different commits. It opens `chore/sync-mudlet-upstream` as a PR when anything
moved, merges it once CI is green, and opens a triage issue when it isn't.

A patch that stops applying is one of the things that issue reports, and it is
the one that needs a human quickly: until it is re-applied by hand the mudix
change it carried is missing from the tree.
